## Introduction
As a machine learning practitioner you can often find yourself dealing with datasets that are challenging to work with. Missing data, a mix of continuous and categorical data, features of differing scales, and features that are mostly filled with null values; data is not always as nicely packaged as the famous iris dataset. This Ames Housing dataset has all of the aforementioned qualities, which makes it a challenging dataset to work with and an excellent way to cut one's teeth on a machine learning task. Hosted on the data science website kaggle, the dataset is the centerpiece of an ongoing competition inviting practitioners to demonstrate their knowledge of advanced regression techniques. Although I will not be submitting to their leaderboard, [I invite you to read more about the competition on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/rules) and use what you learn here to develop your own machine learning model for the competition. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate one approach to thoroughly preprocess a dataset and train a well-performing regression model to predict the sale price of a home based on its many features.
